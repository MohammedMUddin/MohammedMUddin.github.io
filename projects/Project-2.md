In recent years, the explosion of social networking sites and online blogs provide viewers with a lot of information and opinion. There are thousands of people who express unrepressed opinions about different products and their features online with these sites daily. The challenging problem is harnessing these product reviews and the ability to gain a consensus about the feeling of the consumer base.  Effective learning about the content of this information would be impossible for humans based on the sheer amount of data.  The unorganized nature of this information in the English language also presents its challenges.

This system will review customer reviews posted on social media sites such as Twitter that collects, process, and analyze user posted review texts.  Natural language processing, text analysis methods, and machine learning algorithms will be harnessed to detect polarity (positive or negative opinion) from all the messages left by consumers.  The big data from social network websites can be used to identify sentiment/opinion in the customer posted reviews on a user given business or products. This intelligent system for this project will be tested to review the new iPhone 12 released in October of 2020.  

We are currently in the Data Collection phase of the development project and are hopeful to have this project finished by May 2021.
