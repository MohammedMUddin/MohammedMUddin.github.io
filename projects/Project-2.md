The system will review customer reviews posted on social media sites such as Twitter that collects, process, and analyze user posted review texts.  Natural language processing, text analysis methods, and machine learning algorithms will be harnessed to detect polarity (positive or negative opinion) from all the messages left by consumers.  The big data from social network websites can be used to identify sentiment/opinion in the customer posted reviews on a user given business or products. This intelligent system for this project will be tested to review the new iPhone 12 released in October of 2020.
