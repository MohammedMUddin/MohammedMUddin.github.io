<h5>Description</h5>
The SAFE stack project that I worked on has the client application (Front-End)
build using the Fable compiler along with the Elmish state management
system to provide a performant UI that uses the MVU pattern of state
management, and the backend was built with Saturn which is an F# library
that allows routing and hosting applications that are built on top of ASP .NET
Core.
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
This project was built by Me and two of my teammates for our CIS 408 Internet Programming course.
